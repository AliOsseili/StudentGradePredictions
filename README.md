# StudentGradePredictions
This application utilizes machine learning to predict student grades. 

We utilize a Linear Regression model to predict student grades based off of several factors. This example uses factors such as 
previous failures, absences and 2 grades, to predict what their third would be. 

This model generates answers between 91%-85% accurate (From my testing).

The code is commented to explain what does what.

This project uses Tensorflow, sklearn, numpy and pandas. As well as to save the model we use pickle.
